# Clair Route

A.K.A:
![Everybody Hates Clair](/branding.png)

## Overview

This mod offers a Level 2 scene for Clair, the not-so beloved Dragon-type teacher. This is literally the first time I've done a writing project for something outside of school, so I'm confident it's 100% perfect.

This is a highly WIP release that was pushed out due to certain circumstances meaning I won't be able to work much on this for a period of time. Anticipate possible re-writes to the very scene included here.

## Mod Installation
### Requirements
> Version 8.21b.23 of PAL:F

### Installation 

1. Head over to the "Releases" page on GitHub and download the zip file from the latest release.
2. Extract the game folder to PAL:F's root folder. Should ask you to overwrite some files, say yes. Eventually I will migrate this mod to the mod manager, but for now, this means you are almost guaranteed to be unable to install any other mods that you don't merge/create yourself on top of this mod.

## Mod Features

This mod does the following: it puts Clair in the Battle Academy as a potential hang out character (once certain requirements are met) and gives her a Level 2 scene. It also makes you gain a point with her while taking her class, similar to other routes. In addition, it includes a new audio track for you to jam to while doing her scene. All of these things can be utilized to potentially create your own fully-featured new character route mod, too. Eventually, once I migrate over to the mod manager, the intention is to build another walkthrough like my last one on how to do this stuff.

## F.A.Q. (Spoiler Warning)

**The battle with Clair is impossible!**
Clair is literally the 8th gym leader of the 2nd generation games. She's supposed to be difficult to fight. You've also only had 5 weeks to train and build your little rats, so I wouldn't anticipate an easy victory. The route continues regardless of a win here (though if I continue the route later scenes might have stricter requirements.) Yeah, she uses a water strategy, it's weird for her. Don't judge her, okay? She's going through a really rough patch.

**Something's broken!**
Ruh roh raggy! If I have time I'll try and fix it. Submit an issue ticket here on GitHub and I will get around to it when I can. If you ping me about it I will literally make sure your save file cannot romance Clair when it comes time. You can mention it in the mod topic channel but I would very much appreciate it if you did it here.
