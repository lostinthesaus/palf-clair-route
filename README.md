# Clair Route

A.K.A:
![Everybody Hates Clair](/branding.png)

## Overview

This mod offers a Level 2 scene for Clair, the not-so beloved Dragon-type teacher. This is literally the first time I've done a writing project for something outside of school, so I'm confident it's 100% perfect.

This is a highly WIP release that was pushed out due to certain circumstances meaning I won't be able to work much on this for a period of time. Anticipate possible re-writes to the very scene included here.

## Mod Installation
### Requirements
> Version 8.15b of PAL:F

### Installation 

1. Head over to the "Releases" page on GitHub and download the zip file from the latest release.
2. Extract the game folder to PAL:F's root folder. Should ask you to overwrite some files, say yes. Eventually I will migrate this mod to the mod manager, but for now, this means you are almost guaranteed to be unable to install any other mods that you don't merge/create yourself on top of this mod.

## Mod Features

This mod does the following: it puts Clair in the Battle Academy as a potential hang out character (once certain requirements are met) and gives her a Level 2 scene. It also makes you gain a point with her while taking her class, similar to other routes. In addition, it includes a new audio track for you to jam to while doing her scene.

This mod is also packaged so it only includes the necessary files to use the mod, meaning that it has to be installed on-to a copy of PAL:F already downloaded and extracted. This doesn't ensure compatibility, but it does allow you to use this as a base for making your own character routes mods.

## F.A.Q. (Spoiler Warning)

**The battle with Clair is impossible!**
Clair is literally the 8th gym leader of the 2nd generation games. She's supposed to be difficult to fight. You've also only had 5 weeks to train and build your little rats, so I wouldn't anticipate an easy victory. The route continues regardless of a win here (though if I continue the route later scenes might have stricter requirements.) Yeah, she uses a water strategy, it's weird for her. Don't judge her, okay? She's going through a really rough patch.

**Something's broken!**
Ruh roh raggy! If I have time I'll try and fix it. Submit an issue ticket here on GitHub and I will get around to it when I can. If you ping me about it I will literally make sure your save file cannot romance Clair when it comes time. You can mention it in the mod topic channel but I would very much appreciate it if you did it here.
