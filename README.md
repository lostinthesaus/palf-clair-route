# Clair Route

A.K.A:
![Everybody Hates Clair](/branding.png)

## Overview

This mod offers a Level 2 scene for Clair, the not-so beloved Dragon-type teacher. This is literally the first time I've done a writing project for something outside of school, so I'm confident it's 100% perfect.

## Mod Installation
### Requirements
> Version 8.21b.23 of PAL:F

### Installation 

1. Head over to the "Releases" page on GitHub and download the zip file from the latest release.
2. Extract the game folder to PAL:F's root folder. Should ask you to overwrite some files, say yes. Eventually I will migrate this mod to the mod manager, but for now, this means you are almost guaranteed to be unable to install any other mods that you don't merge/create yourself on top of this mod.

## Mod Explanation

This mod does the following: it puts Clair in the Battle Academy as a potential hang out character (once certain requirements are met) and gives her a Level 2 scene. It also makes you gain a point with her while taking her class, similar to other routes.
